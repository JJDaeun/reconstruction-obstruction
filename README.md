## The Game

A good home is hard to find, and even harder to fix. "Reconstruction Obstruction" is a single-player action game where you play as a traveler fighting to regain control of their sentient home gone mad. With your trusty hammer in hand, repair your residence one nail at a time. But be wary; your home is outfitted with a variety of tools that will only impede you as you perform the repairs.
